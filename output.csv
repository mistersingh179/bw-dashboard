Your dog’s coat has evolved to clean itself of the basic day-to-day grime, and given that they can’t sweat, they won’t be producing any BO in the way we would define it. 
 That being said, we are all aware of a certain funk that can build up on our dogs if they haven’t been washed or groomed for a while. For many owners, this isn’t an issue, but for those who find themselves with a stinky pup, we would advise that you wash your dog no more than once per month – less if you can.

Too much washing can actually cause your dog some problems, as they have very sensitive skin. What’s more, if you use any flea or worming treatments that are applied to your dog’s coat, these will be washed out with each bath leaving your pet vulnerable to those parasites. 
 Whether your dog has been splashing in muddy puddles, or even rolling about in animal poo, if your pooch returns home as a mucky pup, it is important that you wash or wipe them down as soon as possible.

 Keep Decorations Out of Reach. Candles may bring an extra glow to that jack-o-lantern, but make sure they are not in reach of your dogs and cats.

 Cons of Vegan Dog Food 
 Nutritional deficiencies: While a well-formulated vegan diet can provide all the necessary nutrients for a dog, it can be challenging to ensure that all the essential nutrients are present and balanced. Be sure to consult your veterinarian or pet nutritionist before switching to a vegan diet. 
 Protein source: Animal protein is the best source of protein for dogs as it contains essential amino acids. Plant-based protein sources may be lower in some of these essential amino acids, which can lead to deficiencies if not balanced properly.

 Palatability: Some dogs may not find plant-based food as appealing as meat-based food and be less likely to eat it. This can make it difficult to ensure that they are getting the proper nutrition. 
 Cost: Plant-based dog food can be more expensive than traditional dog food.

Cooper ambitiously volunteers to take on one of the agency’s most treacherous missions. We follow Cooper, the most unlikely CIA candidate, as she comically takes on this dangerous operation in an action-packed film. The movie includes music performed by Ziggy Marley, Joe Jonas, and Demi Lovato. 
 Spy features other big names, such as Jude Law, Raad Rawi, Jessica Chaffin, and Miranda Hart- who were all seen at last night’s movie premier in NYC. Melissa McCarthy caught viewer’s attention by her noticeable weight loss, and further surprised guests by wearing one of her very own designs from her up-in-coming line, Melissa McCarthy Seven7. It is reported her clothing line will be available in August on her website MelissaMcCarthy.com. 
 We are very excited to see McCarthy and her cast mates when this film hits theaters on June 5th.

Technically, the hurricane didn’t “bring” mosquitoes, but it did whip them up in a frenzy. I guess all the standing water triggered something in the parasitic little vampires akin to the rut for deer. 
 That really is unfortunate, too, as the deer rut is what hunters wait for. However, how is a hunter supposed to take a deer during rut, or even pre-rut, if the hunter is too busy swatting at those little flying hypodermic needles with a lust for blood? 
 Seriously though, mosquitoes are on a rampage with a thirst for blood as being reported everywhere from Myrtle Beach to Nags Head to the Pisgah National Forest and everywhere, and I do mean everywhere, in between.

Only 51 percent of Latinos would want their children to make the same financial decisions (saving, investing, and budgeting) that they did. 
 A recent survey of 2,000 Americans between 18 and 41, half of whom identify as Latino, found that non-Latino respondents were much more likely to want their children to learn from and model their own money habits (76% vs. 51%). 
 Regardless of identity, respondents cited not saving money (45%), spending on things they didn’t need (45%), and getting into debt without a plan (41%) as the top financial mistakes they wouldn’t want their kids to repeat. Forty-seven percent wished their high school had prepared them better to manage their money as adults.

 Image: IStock 
 Being sedentary increases your blood sugar levels, and increases the risk of contracting diabetes and heart diseases. When you don’t exercise, the tissues and muscles cannot absorb the sugar from your blood for sufficient energy. Therefore, the blood sugar rises rapidly. This can happen within five days after you quit working out. Your metabolism slows down rapidly. Only a week after you start exercising, you will notice a drop in your blood sugar levels. Even type2 diabetes is reversible. All you need is 30 minutes of non-stop exercise everyday.

 Image: IStock 
 Only three weeks after you stop working out, your physical endurance and strength face a major setback. The muscular strength that was built owing to all the exercise starts to decrease. The good news is, all the strength can be regained, but it will take longer to rebuild the lost strength than it took to lose it. So, without any further delay, start working out, and build your endurance again.
